# MERN Book Inventory Project

This is my first MERN stack project, a book inventory management system.

## Description

The MERN Book Inventory Project is a web application that allows users to manage a collection of books. It provides features such as adding new books, updating book details, and deleting books from the inventory. The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can create an account and log in to access the book inventory.
- Book management: Users can add new books, update book details, and delete books from the inventory.
- Search functionality: Users can search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, or genre.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store book data.
- Express.js: A web application framework used to build the server-side of the application.
